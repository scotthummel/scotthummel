            <h3>Thinking Outside the Box</h3>

            <h3>Going the Extra Mile</h3>

            <p>Scott was our "Webmaster" for our annual Spring Break Conference. He stuck with the job for four years and turned our website into a functional, user friendly professional on line "face" for our event. He always went the extra mile to make sure things were working up to his high expectations. Really I can't say enough good things about his work for us!</p>

            <h3>Fast Turnaround Time</h3>

            <p>Piscean Design (now SH Interactive) did a fantastic job with Care Directions’ website. Scott Hummel listened to our needs and found the best platform for us, and in a very fast turnaround time got out site up and running. Scott made numerous recommendations for our site and added features that we had not contemplated – all good. Care Directions is grateful to Piscean Design for its professional development services, and appreciate the technical support we’ve received after development.</p>
